## Data Exploration with R

Introduction
This document presents the findings from the data exploration conducted on tornado activity using the 'tordata' DataFrame. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in tornado occurrences and their magnitudes across different months and states.

Data Overview
str(tordata): This command was used to display the structure of the data, helping in understanding the types of data stored in each column.
Visualizations and Insights
Histogram of Tornadoes by Month

The histogram indicates that tornado occurrences peak in May, followed closely by June, highlighting a concentration of tornado activities in the middle of the year.
Boxplot of Tornadoes by Month

The boxplot further confirms the increased tornado activity during May, with notable magnitudes observed.
State-wise Tornado Occurrences

Analysis reveals that Texas (TX) experiences the most tornadoes, followed by Kansas (KS). This insight is critical for regional preparedness strategies.
Magnitude and Impact of Tornadoes

The data indicates that May not only has the highest number of tornadoes but also experiences some of the most severe ones in terms of magnitude.
Comparison of Fatalities and Injuries Across States

A comparative analysis shows Texas and Alabama experiencing higher fatalities and injuries, underscoring the significant impact of tornadoes in these states.
Trend Analysis Over Years

The exploration suggests an increasing trend in tornado occurrences over the years, necessitating enhanced monitoring and preparedness.
Conclusion
Both R and Python proved to be effective tools for this analysis. Personally, I found Python to be more user-friendly and conducive to learning new aspects of data exploration, making it my preferred tool for this kind of analysis.
