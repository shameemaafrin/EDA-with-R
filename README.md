## Data Exploration with R

### Introduction
This document presents the findings from the data exploration conducted on tornado activity using the 'tordata' DataFrame. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in tornado occurrences and their magnitudes across different months and states.

### Data Overview
str(tordata): This command was used to display the structure of the data, helping in understanding the types of data stored in each column.

The data indicates that May not only has the highest number of tornadoes but also experiences some of the most severe ones in terms of magnitude.
Comparison of Fatalities and Injuries Across States

The exploration suggests an increasing trend in tornado occurrences over the years, necessitating enhanced monitoring and preparedness.
### Conclusion
Both R and Python proved to be effective tools for this analysis. Personally, I found Python to be more user-friendly and conducive to learning new aspects of data exploration, making it my preferred tool for this kind of analysis.
